# glint

A simple 2D game framework for [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

Glint was inspired by a number of game engines and libraries, including but not limited to [LÃ¶ve2D](https://love2d.org/),  [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), [DragonRuby GTK](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game), [microStudio](https://microstudio.dev/) and [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/).

Glint doesn't try to replicate them, but it does try to take from them core ideas that make games programming actually fun.   It aims to make the necessary parts easy, and make the awesome parts possible.

## Prerequisites

Raylib should already be installed.  If not, you can install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew install raylib
```

## Installation

1. Create a new Crystal app:

    ```bash
    $ cd my-dev-dir            # or wherever you develop
    $ crystal init app my_app  # create a new Crystal app
    $ cd my_app                # the new app directory
    ```

2. Add the Glint dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     glint:
       github: bluematt/glint
   ```

3. Install the glint shard and other dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ shards install  # install dependencies
    $ shards check    # optional: make sure dependencies are installed
    ```

## Usage

```crystal
# my_game.cr
require "glint"

class MyGame < Game
  def initialize
    @display_fps = true
    super(800, 600, "My Awesome Game")
  end

  def draw
    Label.draw("Hello, World!")
  end
end
```

### Running and compilation

To run while developing:

```bash
$ crystal run my_game.cr
```

To compile for release:

```bash
$ crystal build my_game.cr --release --no-debug
$ ./my_game
```

### Documentation

To generate the HTML documentation for the Glint API:

```bash
$ cd ./lib/glint        # the local glint library
$ crystal docs          # generate the glint docs locally
$ open docs/index.html  # open HTML docs in your default browser
```

### Running tests
